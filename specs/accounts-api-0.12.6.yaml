  title: PortX ORCA Account Management
  description: "PortX ORCA semantic and interaction is based on ISO 20022 and restricted to the US banking domain. The scope covers the following communication flows: bank account opening, maintenance, closing and reporting.\nIn many cases, the financial institution will require additional documentation that is available as PDF or Word document. The recommended solution is to group one ORCA message (for example the account opening request) with these accompanying documents in one file archive. The archive establishes the link between the different documents.\nEvery ORCA request message has an attribute to support the ISO 20022 digital signature. \n"

              AutomaticPayment:
              This billing option allows the borrower to choose the "automatic payment" method for their loan. The borrower will specify their preferred payment day, usually the 1st or the last day of the month. The lender will automatically debit the borrower's bank account on the specified payment day, without the need for any manual intervention.
              RegularBilling:
               In this billing option, the borrower will be responsible for making their loan payments manually. The borrower must pay the interest and the principal amount at regular intervals, usually monthly, quarterly, or annually.
              LumpSumPayment: In this billing option, the borrower is required to pay off the entire loan balance in a single payment, usually at the end of the loan term. This payment includes both the outstanding principal amount and the accumulated interest.
              NegotiatedBillingOption: In this option, the lender and the borrower may negotiate and agree on a unique payment schedule that best suits their individual financial situations. This option may involve customized payment frequencies, additional payment fees, or a combination of automatic and manual payment options.
              AcceleratedBillingOption: In this billing option, the borrower may choose to make extra loan payments, either as a lump sum or over a specific period. This can potentially reduce the overall interest payments and loan repayment period.

              A memo post is a transaction that has not yet been posted but is included in the current day’s available balance until the nightly ledger update. During the ledger update, the transaction is processed and Cleared for the next day.
